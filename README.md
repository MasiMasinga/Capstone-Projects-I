# Capstone-Projects-I

## Purpose of the Project
This dataset analyses and visualizes the car prices, fuel type from 
the Automobile dataset in order to predict the most probable car price.

## Data being analysed
•	Normalized Losses of Vehicles
•	Fuel Type Frequencies
•	Vehicle Modifications

## How the data is being analysed
Visualizations, we used the Matplotlib library and we used graphs like the Histogram, pie chart, scatterplot, bar chat, regression chart and correlation 
chart to display things like the horsepower, fuel type and price of vehicles. 

## The Main Findings 
•	The findings and the discovery of the dataset lead me to know that vehicles with a good compression
ratio, horsepower and engine size are more likely to be expensive.
